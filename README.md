Summary of the project
Objective: The project aims to predict the customer segment for new potential customers in target markets based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics.
Approach: We plan to explore the dataset, conduct feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling, and train machine learning models using classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and K-means clustering.
Challenges: Challenges may include dealing with missing data, encoding categorical variables, selecting relevant features, and evaluating model performance accurately.
